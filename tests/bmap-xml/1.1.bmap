<!-- This file contains block map for an image file. The block map
     is basically a list of block numbers in the image file. It lists
     only those blocks which contain data (boot sector, partition
     table, file-system metadata, files, directories, extents, etc).
     These blocks have to be copied to the target device. The other
     blocks do not contain any useful data and do not have to be
     copied to the target device. Thus, using the block map users can
     flash the image fast. So the block map is just an optimization.
     It is OK to ignore this file and just flash the entire image to
     the target device if the flashing speed is not important.

     Note, this file contains commentaries with useful information
     like image size in gigabytes, percentage of mapped data, etc.
     This data is there merely to make the XML file human-readable.

     The 'version' attribute is the block map file format version in
     the 'major.minor' format. The version major number is increased
     whenever we make incompatible changes to the block map format,
     meaning that the bmap-aware flasher would have to be modified in
     order to support the new format. The minor version is increased
     in case of compatible changes. For example, if we add an attribute
     which is optional for the bmap-aware flasher. -->
